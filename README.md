# Hunter Douglas PowerView Shade Indigo Plugin

This plugin lets you control [Hunter Douglas PowerView][hd_powerview] shades
from the [Indigo Domotics][indigo] home control software.

## Getting Started

To use this plugin you will need PowerView motorized shades, the PowerView
hub, and the Indigo software.

First determine the hostname or IP address of your PowerView Hub.  To
determine this:

* Open the PowerView mobile app
* Tap on the house name in the top left
* Tap on the hub name above "Scene Controllers"
* Tap "Info"
* Tap "Network Info"
* Tap "Static IP"

You need the value from the "IP address" field even if you do not have a
static IP configured.  If the plugin stops controlling your shades and you
find the IP Address has changed in the PowerView mobile app you may need to
set a static IP.  Consult your router or access point documentation as well.

Next create a new device with the PowerView type and PowerView Hub model.
Fill in the IP address from the previous step.  The "Discover shades" button
will create the PowerView Shade devices for you automatically.  You can do
this manually as well, if you want to perform the labor manually.

Clicking this button multiple times will have no effect, the plugin won't
create the same shade twice.

You can now create actions to control shades using the actions described
below.

Optionally you can edit each PowerView Shade device to fill in the heading of
the window each shade covers to open or close shades depending on the sun
angle.  Open the compass app on your phone, touch it to your window, and enter
the value the compass shows.

## Features

Automatically shade discovery for easy first-time setup.  This also makes it
easy to new shades, or the shade gets disconnected from the hub for some
reason.  You can run the discovery process again then transfer the PowerView
Hub ID in Indigo from the new shade device to the old shade device so all your
actions continue to work.

Adjust shade positions from Indigo-supported keypads using the Set Shade
Position, Activate Scene, or Activate Scene Collection actions.

Adjust shades based on criteria beyond schedules including:

* Window-open sensors to prevent shades from closing when a window is open,
  causing them to blow around.
* Interior or exterior temperature to keep heat out of rooms you aren't using
* Sun angle (from the [Cynical Weather][cynical_weather] plugin) using the
  heading field of the shade device for automatic shading
  based on season.

Multiple hub support.  You can control shades and activate scenes across
multiple hubs.

## Supported Actions

The following Indigo actions are supported:

### Activate Scene

Activate a scene you have created in the PowerView mobile app.  This allows
you to reuse your existing PowerView scenes without having to recreate them in
Indigo.

### Activate Scene Collection

Activate a scene collection you have created in the PowerView mobile app.
This allows you to reuse your existing PowerView scenes collections without
having to recreate them in Indigo.

### Calibrate Shade

Rediscovers the movement limits of the shade.

### Jog Shade

Moves the shade a tiny bit.  This helps you identify which shade the device is
interacting with.

### Set Shade Position

Set the shade position of an individual shade.  This allows you to set the top
and bottom positions of a shade for a top-down, bottom-up shade or the shade
position for a single-direction shade.

## Usage Notes

The plugin does not poll the hub, so triggers based on the position (or any
other attribute) of shades or the hub will not execute when you expect.

Polling the hub does not solve this as the hub does not have a long-term
memory of shade positions.  To reliably know the shade positions you need to
move the shade somehow (at least jog it) which shortens the battery life of
the shades.
